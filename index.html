                    <p>It’s what decision makers want from their analytical team. As companies around the world are accelerating their transition towards an increasingly data-driven business model, the power of analytics is becoming more important than ever. To me, all of this makes sense and it’s clear why; Data illustrates the story. It gives natural occurrences numerical meaning. It holds the unique power to tell the truth of real-world functionality. Data truly is important, and its applications are limitless. That’s what attracted me to data science.</p>
                    <p>I bring 3+ years of experience in the sales and service industry, including graduation from the Cintas Management Trainee program and as a corporate trainer. I supported research projects as an intern with a leading agricultural research and advisory firm and bring an entrepreneurial history. I hope to combine my unique business background with today’s technical skills to help inform decision-makers and drive growth of a forward-looking company.</p>
                    <p>I have a certificate of Data Analytics from the University of Denver and a BS in Business Management from Texas A&M University. I am skilled in Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib, SQL, Natural Language Processing and other data manipulation and visualization tools. I thrive in analytical, problem-solving environments and hope to combine these skills with my public speaking and operational management background to provide far-reaching value for a great company.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>This app calculates a sentiment score for any business name or relevant social topic based on recently published tweets. The topic is chosen by the user before related tweets are analyzed using Natural Language Processing. A ‘sentiment score’ between 1-5 is returned to the user along with examples of tweets used during the analysis. This project leverages data from the Twitter API.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>This project examines which historically important voter issues Americans are most focused on today and if those issues have changed when compared to recent election years. The analysis uses data from the New York Times API to visualize trends in publication frequencies across the chosen topics. Python’s Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries are used to analyze and visualize the data. Markdown of analysis is included in the <a id="email" href="https://github.com/loganbonsignore/media_consumption_analysis/blob/master/important_voter_issues_analysis.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p>

                    <p>Google and OpenWeatherMap API’s are used to visualize weather conditions of 500+ cities across the world. Weather conditions are compared based on varying distance from the equator. Summary statistics and linear regressions are used to determine which climate factors are having the largest impact on current weather conditions.</p>

                    <p>In this project the SQLAlchemy library is used to analyze Hawaii’s weather data which is housed in a database. The ORM model is used to query the database using object-oriented programming. In addition, the Flask library is used to build an API <a id="email" href="https://github.com/loganbonsignore/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/master/app.py">(app.py)</a> that returns Hawaii’s weather data based on the user’s custom parameters.</p>
