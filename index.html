                    <p>It’s what decision makers want from their analytics team. As global companies are accelerating their transition towards an increasingly data-driven business model, the power of analytics is becoming more important than ever. To me, this is not surprising as data holds the unique power to truth of real-world functionality. It gives natural occurrences numerical meaning. It illustrates what we cant see. Data truly is important, and its applications are limitless. That’s what attracted me to data science.</p>
                    <p>Building on 3+ years of experience in the sales and service industry, including graduation from the Cintas Management Trainee program and as a corporate trainer, I enjoy using my unique business background and today’s technical skills to inform decision-makers and drive growth for forward-looking companies. As a college intern for Rabobank, I developed global agricultural research data and also bring an entrepreneurial mindset.</p>
                    <p>My Data Analytics certification from the University of Denver builds on a BS in Business Management from Texas A&M University. Technical skills include Excel, VBA scripting, Python, SQL, Javascript, Web Scraping, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, MongoDB and other data manipulation and visualization tools. I thrive in analytical, problem-solving environments and plan to combine these skills with my public speaking and operational management background to deliver a uniquely skilled data technologist with a business focus.</p>

                    <p><a id="email" href="https://github.com/loganbonsignore/twitter-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/sentimate_analysis.ipynb">This notebook</a> calculates a sentiment score for any business name or relevant social topic based on recently published tweets. The topic is chosen by the user before related tweets are analyzed using Natural Language Processing. A ‘sentiment score’ between 1-5 is returned to the user along with examples of tweets used during the analysis. This project leverages data from the Twitter API.</p>

                    <p>This project examines which historically important voter issues Americans are most focused on today and if those issues have changed when compared to recent election years. The analysis uses data from the New York Times API to visualize trends in publication frequencies across the chosen topics. Python’s Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries are used to analyze and visualize the data.

                    <p>Google and OpenWeatherMap API’s are used to visualize weather conditions of 500+ cities across the world. Weather conditions are compared based on varying distance from the equator. Summary statistics and linear regressions are used to determine which climate factors are having the largest impact on current weather conditions. <a id="email" href="https://github.com/loganbonsignore/API-Challenge/blob/master/WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb" target="_blank">This notebook</a> contains examples of the statistical analysis.</p>
