                    <p>It’s what decision makers want from their analytics team. As global companies are accelerating their transition towards an increasingly data-driven business model, the power of analytics is becoming more important than ever. To me, this is not surprising as data holds the unique power to truth of real-world functionality. It gives natural occurrences numerical meaning. It illustrates what we can't see. Data truly is important, and its applications are limitless. That’s what attracted me to data science.</p>
                    <p>Building on 3+ years of experience in the sales and service industry, including graduation from the Cintas Management Trainee program and as a corporate trainer, I thrive in situations where I can use my unique business background and today’s technical skills to help inform decision-makers and drive growth.</p>
                    <p>Completion of the University of Denver's Data Science program builds on a BS in Business Management from Texas A&M University. My technical skills include Excel, VBA scripting, Python, SQL, Javascript, Web Scraping, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Tableau, Hadoop, MongoDB and other data manipulation and visualization tools. I thrive in analytical, problem-solving environments and plan to combine these skills with my public speaking and operational management background to deliver a uniquely skilled data technologist with a business focus.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>This full-stack web app leverages Twitter's data to give decision makers an easy way to gauge market sentiment towards their product or brand. Sentiment is determined using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Upon user input of a business name and location, the latest tweets related to that business are retrieved from Twitter's API before the app calculates a sentiment score between 1-5. The app returns this sentiment score along with examples of tweets used during the analysis and other information about the business including hours, location, reviews, pictures, etc. Raw tweet data is collected from Twitter's API at the time of user interaction.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>This project examines which historically important voter issues Americans are most focused on today and if those issues have changed when compared to recent election years. The analysis uses data from the New York Times API to visualize trends in publication frequencies of content related to historically important voter issues. The impact of Covid-19 on coverage of the upcoming presidential election is also explored. Python’s Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries are used to analyze and visualize the data. Markdown and analysis are included in <a id="email" href="https://github.com/loganbonsignore/media_consumption_analysis/blob/master/important_voter_issues_analysis.ipynb" target="_blank">this notebook</a>.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>The project focuses on providing Colorado business data to interested parties through an API. A database of 7000 businesses in Colorado is constructed using web scraping and Yelp's API. A detailed breakdown of the ETL process can be found <a id="email" href="https://github.com/RoarkJ/foodies_api" target="_blank">here</a>. We built our own API to allow users to retrieve business specific data from our database based on custom queries. The user has the option to narrow their search based on business name, city, zip, etc. The API was built using Python and Flask. Selenium, BeautifulSoup and Chromedriver were used to scrape data from the web. All data is housed in a MongoDB database.</p>

                    <p>Google and OpenWeatherMap API’s are used to visualize weather conditions of 500+ cities across the world. Weather conditions are compared based on varying distance from the equator.
