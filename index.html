                    <p>It’s what management teams want from their data analyst. Leveraging tools like Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib, SQL, Machine Learning and more is enabling analysts with the right combination of skills to transform disheveled data into something valuable that illustrates a story. It can help inform decision makers by providing a data-based operational understanding, cost forecasting, or competitor performance analysis. Data holds the unique power to tell the truth of real-world functionality and data never lies. (Properly sourced, clean data that is).</p>
                    <p>That’s what attracted me to data science. I bring 3+ years of experience in the sales and service industry including graduation from the Cintas Management Trainee program and one year as a corporate trainer. I’ve spent time as an intern with a leading agriculture research and advisory firm and bring an entrepreneurial history. I hope to combine my unique business background with forward looking technical skills to extract actionable insights from big data that will help inform decision-makers and drive growth.</p>
                    <p>I have a certificate of Data Analytics from the University of Denver and a BS of Business Management from Texas A&M University. I am skilled in Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib, SQL, Natural Language Processing, Tableau, Hadoop and other data manipulation and visualization tools. I thrive in analytical, problem solving environments and hope to combine that with my public speaking and operational management background to provide immense value to the great company.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>This app calculates a consumer sentimate score for any business or popular topic based on positive or negative sentimate in recently published tweets. The topic is chosen by the user before related tweets are requested from Twitter's API and analyzed using Natural Language Processing to identify positive or negative sentimate. A sentimate score is calculated and returned to the user along with a few examples of tweets used during the analysis.</p>
